# LLMs for Personal Assistance
## Repository Description
This library contains parts of the code that implements the project, and is only intended as supplemental material to the project to help markers better understand the work I have undertaken for this project. Due to size and permission limitations on some of the data and models, I am unable to upload them here.
If you want to reproduce the chatbot in this project, please visit https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct to access the original Llama-3-8B-Instruct model and follow the procedures in my report and code for fine-tuning and usage.
